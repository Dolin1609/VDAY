        <p>Dear [Murgiii(Nilo)],</p>
        <p>I’m beyond thankful for you, and every moment we share feels like something truly special. You make everything feel brighter, and I can't help but smile knowing how meaningful your presence is in my life. The time we spend together always flies by—I lose track of the hours, because with you, even hours feel like minutes. 💫.</p>
        <p>Wishing you a day filled with love and happiness!</p>
